1. Rice Firefox ( Manuall )
  
    * Enabling the Modules
   
      Firstly you need to visit `about:config` by puting it in your URL Bar and Clicking Enter. It will display a Popup with the message I accept the risk, click yes and then search for these but one at a time and set everything to **True** by double Clicking them!
      
      `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` <br />
      `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` <br />
      `gfx.webrender.all` <br />
      `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` <br />
       <br />
      
    * Creating the Folder and Files
    
      You need to open Alacritty and execute `cd .mozilla/firefox/` then you can list the files by doing `ls`.
      After that you have to find the folder that has `.default-release` at the end of it and then cd inside it.
      If youre inside the profile Directory you can now execute `mkdir chrome && cd chrome` after that you can move the files from the [Firefox Files](https://github.com/0romos/Deprowave/tree/main/Firefox) inside the chrome folder! When you're done close Firefox using ctrl + q!<br />
